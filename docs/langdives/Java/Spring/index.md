# **Spring**

## **What is Spring ?**
Spring is a popular, open-source Java-based framework used to create enterprise-level applications. It provides a comprehensive programming and configuration model that simplifies Java development. At its core, Spring focuses on dependency injection and inversion of control (IoC), providing an abstraction over Java's complexity.

## **Core goals of Spring**

- Simplify Java development.
- Promote loosely coupled and testable code.
- Offer modularity through different projects (Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring MVC, etc.).


## **Ecosystem Overview**

The Spring ecosystem consists of various projects for different use cases:

- **Core Spring Framework** – Foundation for building Java applications with dependency injection and IoC.
- **Spring Boot** – Simplifies the creation of stand-alone, production-ready Spring applications.
- **Spring MVC** – Web framework for building RESTful APIs and web applications.
- **Spring Security** – Framework for authentication and authorization.
- **Spring Data** – Simplifies interaction with databases.
- **Spring Cloud** – Toolkit for building cloud-native, microservices applications.

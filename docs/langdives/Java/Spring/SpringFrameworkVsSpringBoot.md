## **Differences**

| **Category**                      | **Spring Framework**                                               | **Spring Boot**                                                   |
|------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                       | A comprehensive framework for building Java applications.         | An extension of Spring Framework to simplify configuration and create stand-alone applications. |
| **Setup**                         | Requires manual setup, including XML or Java-based configuration. | Minimal setup with **auto-configuration** based on the classpath.  |
| **Main Focus**                    | Provides flexibility and control over every aspect of the application. | Focuses on **rapid development** with sensible defaults and opinions. |
| **Configuration**                 | Can use **XML, Java-based, or annotation-based configuration**.   | Uses **annotations** and **properties/YAML files** for configuration. |
| **Learning Curve**                | Requires more learning time due to complexity.                     | Easier to get started with for beginners due to auto-configuration and pre-built setups. |
| **Project Dependencies**          | Requires managing multiple dependencies for each feature manually. | Provides **starters** (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`) to include required dependencies. |
| **Embedded Server**               | No embedded server support; WAR files must be deployed to external servers (Tomcat, Jetty, etc.). | Comes with **embedded servers** (Tomcat, Jetty, or Undertow) for running stand-alone applications. |
| **Deployment**                    | Deploy WAR/EAR files to external servers.                         | Runs applications directly as **JAR files** with embedded servers. |
| **Auto-Configuration**            | No auto-configuration; requires manual configuration of components. | Auto-configures components based on available classpath dependencies. |
| **Application Entry Point**       | Relies on external servlet containers to manage the lifecycle.     | Uses **`@SpringBootApplication`** as the entry point with `SpringApplication.run()`. |
| **Microservices Support**         | Not specialized for microservices; requires additional tools.      | Built with **microservices architecture** in mind. Supports Spring Cloud, Eureka, Feign, etc. |
| **Performance**                   | Requires more configuration to optimize performance.              | Better suited for lightweight and high-performance microservices. |
| **Profiles**                      | Supports profiles for environment-specific configurations but requires more setup. | Supports **profiles** easily through `application.yml` or `application.properties`. |
| **Testing**                       | Provides JUnit support but requires manual configuration for context loading. | Provides easy testing with `@SpringBootTest`, `@MockBean`, `@DataJpaTest`, and others. |
| **Security**                      | Uses **Spring Security** but requires manual integration.          | Integrates **Spring Security** easily with `spring-boot-starter-security`. |
| **Database Access**               | Provides **JDBC, JPA, ORM support**, but requires more configuration. | Simplifies database access with **Spring Data JPA** and auto-configuration of `DataSource`. |
| **Starters and Dependency Management** | Requires manual management of dependencies and configurations. | Provides **Spring Boot Starters** that bundle all required dependencies for specific use cases. |
| **Template Engines**              | Supports Thymeleaf, JSP, and others with manual setup.             | Supports template engines with **starters** (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`). |
| **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  | No built-in CLI support.                                           | Provides **Spring Boot CLI** to run Groovy scripts for quick development. |
| **Actuator and Monitoring**       | Requires external monitoring tools or custom configurations.       | Comes with **Spring Boot Actuator** to monitor application health, metrics, and endpoints. |
| **DevTools for Hot Reload**       | Requires manual setup for hot reloading of code changes.           | Provides **Spring Boot DevTools** for hot reloading during development. |
| **Support for Reactive Programming** | Supports **Spring WebFlux** and Project Reactor (from version 5.x). | Fully supports **Spring WebFlux** for reactive, non-blocking programming. |
| **Circuit Breakers & Resilience** | Requires integration with third-party libraries like Hystrix.      | Seamlessly integrates with **Resilience4j** and **Spring Cloud** for resilience. |
| **Integration with Cloud Platforms** | Requires Spring Cloud or manual setup for cloud integration.       | Seamlessly integrates with **Spring Cloud** for cloud-native development. |
| **Logging Configuration**         | Requires manual configuration of logging frameworks (e.g., Log4j, SLF4J). | Provides **auto-configured logging** using Logback by default. |
| **Health Checks and Metrics**     | Requires manual configuration to expose health metrics.            | Provides **Actuator endpoints** (`/actuator/health`, `/actuator/metrics`) out-of-the-box. |
| **Web Framework**                 | Uses **Spring MVC** for building web applications.                  | Uses **Spring MVC** or **Spring WebFlux** with easy setup through starters. |
| **Restful API Development**       | Requires manual setup of controllers and components.               | Provides easy development with `@RestController` and auto-configuration of REST endpoints. |
| **Command-Line Arguments Support** | Requires manual handling of command-line arguments.                | Easily reads command-line arguments with `SpringApplication` or `@Value`. |
| **Caching Support**               | Requires setting up **EhCache, Guava**, or other caching solutions manually. | Provides easy caching configuration with `@EnableCaching` and **auto-configuration**. |
| **Internationalization (i18n)**   | Supports i18n but requires more setup.                             | Supports i18n with minimal configuration through `application.properties`. |
| **Job Scheduling**                | Requires integration with Quartz or other scheduling libraries.    | Supports scheduling with `@Scheduled` and **Task Executors**. |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)**     | Provides dependency injection with **IoC container**.              | Same as Spring Framework but simplifies it with **auto-wiring** using `@Autowired`. |
| **Backward Compatibility**        | Must manually update configurations when upgrading versions.       | Provides **backward compatibility** with most Spring projects. |
| **Community and Ecosystem**       | Large community and extensive ecosystem.                           | Built on top of Spring Framework with additional tools for modern development. |

## **Summary**

**Spring Boot simplifies Spring Framework** by:

  - Automating configuration.
  - Providing embedded servers.
  - Offering out-of-the-box starters for common features.

**Spring Framework** gives more control and flexibility but at the cost of manual setup and configuration.

**Spring Boot** is optimized for rapid development, especially for microservices and cloud-native applications.

**Spring Framework** is still relevant for legacy applications or when fine-grained control is necessary.

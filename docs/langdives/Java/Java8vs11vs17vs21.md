# **Java 8 vs 11 vs 17 vs 21**

A detailed comparison of Java 8, Java 11, Java 17, and Java 21, summarizing the key differences, improvements, and deprecations introduced across these versions:

---

## **Java 8 (Released March 2014)**

Java 8 is a **long-term support (LTS)** release, bringing significant new features:

### **Major Features**
  - **Lambda Expressions**: Enables functional-style programming.
  - **Stream API**: Helps process collections and data pipelines.
  - **Optional Class**: Helps avoid `NullPointerException`.
  - **Default Methods in Interfaces**: Allows adding new methods to interfaces without breaking existing code.
  - **New Date and Time API** (`java.time`): Replaces the old `java.util.Date`.
  - **Nashorn JavaScript Engine**: Allows embedding JavaScript in Java applications.

### **Performance & Security**
  - PermGen space removed (replaced by Metaspace).
  - Improved Garbage Collection (G1 GC available).

### **Drawbacks**
  - Older TLS 1.2 implementation.
  - Less modular structure.

---

## **Java 11 (Released Sept 2018)**

Java 11 is also **LTS** and a significant milestone since it removed many outdated APIs and modularized the runtime.

### **Major Features**
  - **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters** (`var` in lambda).
  - **HTTP Client API (Standardized)**: Supports HTTP/2.
  - **String Enhancements**: `lines()`, `strip()`, `repeat()`, `isBlank()` methods.
  - **Files API Improvements**: `readString()`, `writeString()`, `isSameFile()` methods.
  - **Nest-Based Access Control**: Easier access between nested classes.
  - **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**: A scalable low-latency GC.

### **Removals & Deprecations**
  - Removal of **Java EE and CORBA modules**.
  - **Nashorn JavaScript Engine** deprecated.
  - Applet API deprecated.

### **Performance & Security**
  - TLS 1.3 support.
  - Better memory management (e.g., with **ZGC**).

## **Java 17 (Released Sept 2021)**

Java 17 is an **LTS release**, refining many features introduced in Java 9-16 and stabilizing the platform.

### **Major Features**
  - **Sealed Classes**: Restricts which classes can extend or implement a particular class.
  - **Pattern Matching for `instanceof`**: Simplifies type casting.
  - **Records**: Concise way to model immutable data.
  - **Text Blocks**: Multi-line string literals.
  - **Foreign Function and Memory API (Preview)**: Facilitates interoperation with native libraries.
  - **Enhanced Switch (Pattern Matching, Switch Expressions)**.

### **Removals & Deprecations**
  - **Deprecated Security Manager**.
  - **RMI Activation** removed.
  - **Applet API** removed.
  
### **Garbage Improvements**
  - **ZGC** and **Shenandoah GC** production-ready.

### **Performance & Security**
  - Stronger encapsulation in the JDK modules.
  - Better startup, memory, and GC performance.

---

## **Java 21 (Released Sept 2023)**

Java 21 is a **non-LTS release** (though with unofficial support from some vendors). It introduces many experimental and innovative features.

### **Major Features**
  - **Virtual Threads** (Part of Project Loom): Lightweight threads for highly scalable applications.
  - **Structured Concurrency (Incubator)**: Simplifies working with multiple concurrent tasks.
  - **Record Patterns** (Preview): Extends pattern matching.
  - **Unnamed Patterns and Variables**: Reduces verbosity when matching.
  - **Sequenced Collections**: New `List`, `Set`, and `Map` with defined iteration order.
  - **String Templates**: Simplifies string formatting.

### **Removals & Deprecations:**
  - **Security Manager** fully removed.
  - Deprecated APIs cleaned up.

### **Performance & Security:**
  - Further **GC enhancements** (ZGC, Shenandoah).
  - Virtual threads allow **non-blocking I/O** models, improving scalability.

## **Summary**

- **Java 8**: Best suited for legacy systems; widely adopted but outdated.
- **Java 11**: A stable upgrade for Java 8 users with modern features and TLS 1.3.
- **Java 17**: The most recommended LTS version, offering modern features like records, sealed classes, and better performance.
- **Java 21**: Introduces bleeding-edge technology such as virtual threads and structured concurrency, but being non-LTS, itâ€™s suitable for developers eager to experiment or early adopters. 

For production systems, upgrading to Java 17 is generally recommended unless your project needs experimental features from Java 21.
